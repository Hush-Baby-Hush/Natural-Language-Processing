#### Learning Goals

1. Be able to describe key concepts, models and challenges in Natural Language Processing
   (this includes linguistic concepts such as POS tags, morphemes, phrase structure trees, dependency trees, various grammar formalisms, computational models such as recurrent and convolutional neural nets, HMMs, PCFGs, IBM models for machine translation; challenges include Zipf's law; lexical, syntactic, semantic, referential ambiguity) 

2. Be able to describe, implement, and apply a variety of fundamental algorithms in Natural Language Processing
   (e.g. HMMs, CKY parsers, IBM alignment models)

3. Be able to describe and evaluate more complex software systems for various Natural Language Processing tasks 

4. Be able to describe current approaches, datasets and systems for various Natural Language Processing tasks
