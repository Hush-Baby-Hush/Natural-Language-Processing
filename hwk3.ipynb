Like the RNN, we use the prediction of the decoder as the input to the decoder for the sequence of outputs. For the RNN, at time step $t_i$ the decoder takes the hidden state $h_{i-1}$ and the previous prediction $w_{i-1}$ at each time step. However, because the transformer does not use recurrences, we do not pass a hidden state; instead, at time step $t_i$ we pass $w_1,w_2 \\cdots w_{i-1}$, which is the entire sequence predicted so far."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AOQh6Cfzohi1"},"source":["### DO NOT EDIT ###\n","\n","def decode_transformer_model(encoder, decoder, src, max_decode_len, trg_vocab, device):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Args:\n","        encoder: Your RnnEncoder object\n","        decoder: Your RnnDecoder object\n","        src: [max_src_length, batch_size] the source sentences you wish to translate\n","        max_decode_len: The maximum desired length (int) of your target translated sentences\n","        trg_vocab: The Vocab_Lang object for the target language\n","        device: the device your torch tensors are on (you may need to call x.to(device) for some of your tensors)\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        curr_output: [batch_size, max_decode_len] containing your predicted translated sentences\n","        curr_predictions: [batch_size, max_decode_len, trg_vocab_size] containing the (unnormalized) probabilities of each\n","            token in your vocabulary at each time step\n","\n","    Pseudo-code:\n","    - Obtain encoder output by encoding src sentences\n","    - For 1 ≤ t ≤ max_decode_len:\n","        - Obtain dec_input as the best words so far for previous time steps (you can get this from curr_output)\n","        - Obtain your (unnormalized) prediction probabilities by feeding dec_input and encoder output to decoder\n","        - Save your (unnormalized) prediction probabilities in curr_predictions at index t\n","        - Calculate the most likely (highest probability) token and save in curr_output at timestep t\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    # Initialize variables\n","    batch_size = src.size(1)\n","    curr_output = torch.zeros((batch_size, max_decode_len))\n","    curr_predictions = torch.zeros((batch_size, max_decode_len, len(trg_vocab.idx2word)))\n","\n","    # We start the decoding with the start token for each example\n","    dec_input = torch.tensor([[trg_vocab.word2idx['<start>']]] * batch_size).transpose(0,1)\n","    curr_output[:, 0] = dec_input.squeeze(1)\n","    \n","    enc_output = encoder(src)\n","\n","    # At each time step, get the best prediction and save it\n","    for t in range(1, max_decode_len):\n","        dec_input = curr_output[:,:t].transpose(0,1)\n","        output = decoder(dec_input.int().to(device), enc_output)\n","        output = output[-1]\n","        curr_predictions[:,t,:] = output\n","        predictions = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)\n","        curr_output[:, t] = predictions\n","\n","    return curr_output, curr_predictions"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"shuxRQ_EWfGa"},"source":["You can run the cell below to qualitatively compare some of the sentences your model generates with the some of the correct translations."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yv3OYDbaWfGd"},"source":["### DO NOT EDIT ###\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    idxes = random.choices(range(len(test_dataset.dataset)), k=5)\n","    src, trg =  train_dataset.dataset[idxes]\n","    curr_output, _ = decode_transformer_model(transformer_encoder, transformer_decoder, src.transpose(0,1).to(device), trg.size(1), trg_vocab, device)\n","    for i in range(len(src)):\n","        print(\"Source sentence:\", ' '.join([x for x in [src_vocab.idx2word[j.item()] for j in src[i]] if x != '<pad>']))\n","        print(\"Target sentence:\", ' '.join([x for x in [trg_vocab.idx2word[j.item()] for j in trg[i]] if x != '<pad>']))\n","        print(\"Predicted sentence:\", ' '.join([x for x in [trg_vocab.idx2word[j.item()] for j in curr_output[i]] if x != '<pad>']))\n","        print(\"----------------\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"W3KeBgqjoVP-"},"source":["## Evaluate Transformer Model [20 points]\n","\n","Now we can run the test set through the transformer model.
